The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. It is one of the most experienced PCB manufacturers with more than a decade in the field of PCB prototype and fabrication, they are committed to meeting the needs of our customers from different industries in terms of quality, delivery, cost-effectiveness and any other demanding requests.

# Introduction
The LMR14030 is a 40 V, 3.5 A step-down regulator with an integrated high-side MOSFET. With a wide input range from 4 V to 40 V, it's suitable for various applications from industrial to automotive for power conditioning from unregulated sources. The regulator's quiescent current is 40 A in Sleep-mode, which is suitable for battery-powered systems. An ultra-low 1 UA current in shutdown mode can further prolong battery life. A wide adjustable switching frequency range allows either efficiency or external component size to be optimized. Internal loop compensation means that the user is free from the tedious task of loop compensation design. This also minimizes the external components of the device. A precision enables input allows simplification of regulator control and system power sequencing. The device also has built-in protection features such as cycle-by-cycle current limit, thermal sensing and shut down due to excessive power dissipation, and output overvoltage protection.

# Ordering the PCBs From JLCPCB

Full Process is shown using Screenshots Step-wise.

Now we have got the PCB design and it’s time to order the PCB’s. For that, you just have to go to JLCPCB, and click on “QUOTE NOW” button.

JLCPCB are also sponsor of this project. JLCPCB (ShenzhenJLC Electronics Co., Ltd.), is the largest PCB prototype enterprise in Chinaand a high-tech manufacturer specializing in quick PCB prototype and small-batch PCB production. You can order a minimum of 5 PCBs for just $2.

To get the PCB manufactured, upload the gerber file you downloaded in the last step. Upload the.zip file or you can also drag and drop the gerber files.

After uploading the zip file, you’ll see a success message at the bottom if the file is successfully uploaded.

You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make sure everything is good. You can view both top and bottom of the PCB. After making sure our PCB looks good, we can now place the order at a reasonable price. You can order 5 PCBs for just $2 but if it’s your first order then you can get 5 PCBs for $2.

To place the order, click on “SAVE TO CART” button. My PCBs took 2 days to get manufactured and arrived within a week using DHL delivery option. PCBs were well packed and the quality was really good.
